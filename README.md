# E-Commerece-XSTORE
PHP &amp; MySQL E-Commerce

I Created this website as part of a assignment in my webdevelopment 2 class at Stockholm University.
The focus here was on functionality where users could place orders based on the inventory of the store and admin could manually add new items in the administrator page. I had a big focus on security in this project and made sure to utilize things like encryption & prepared staments for the database. The site was hosted with Azure but i took the site down once my student credits lapsed.

mysql database



For Testing Purposes:
Admin login:
Username = administrator@admin.com
Password =  Password123!

Database has to be connected or the site will display a error page:

Run SQL Server & assign these variables in connectdb.php:

$server = "";
$username = "";
$password = "";
$db = "";
